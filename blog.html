                                <p>
                                    Hi guys, we’re just approaching our Hack submission tomorrow so I’m back again with another update!
                                </p>
                                <p>Things haven’t been going incredibly smoothly so far, we’ve encountered a lot of issues, hence the theme of this blog being about overcoming adversity 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the issues we’ve had is that it is incredibly hard to meet up as a team, several of us have obligations that prevent meeting up for a decent portion of the week, and some of us have a 3 hour round trip to university which makes coming in only for a meeting to be cancelled has been a frustration for some members! We’ve tried to solve this by using WhatsApp to communicate more and sharing docs through the shared space on Blackboard.

                                 </p>
                                <p>
                                    A further issue is that we’ve had some disagreements with regards to game design and direction, with some wanting a theme resembling something darker like the game Hollow Knight and others wanting something more towards a Sci-Fi theme. Over the coming days we intend to sort this out and head into the MVP with a strong core identity for our project. One positive to contrast this point is that we’ve got a strong grasp of the mechanics we want to demonstrate going into the MVP thanks to some excellent work from Ryan and Mohammed.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We’ve also got our main character design finished by Dan, which you can now see on our homepage!
                                </p>

                                    Hey, Conor back again with another development blog update.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We’ve just received some key feedback from our technical mentor about our workflow, which is something we’re now going to consciously try and improve to create the best MVP we can in the next month or so. We’ve made sure every member of our team is now on our GitHub and is evidencing their contributions by uploading them, either there or to our newly setup Trello board! We’re hoping that this streamlines our software engineering process and makes us a more efficient team. We are also considering beginning weekly short meetings instead of our current sporadic system, but we are finding it hard to fix down a time.                                
                                    </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since our last blog post, we’ve definitely been overcoming some of the challenges we identified at the start. We now have Ben working on enemy AI,  Brad is working on some tilesets, Dave and Alex are working on level design,Marius’ website is beginning to take shape and I’ve planned out a storyline for our game and began work on assisting the level design team. In short - everyone is now working towards a common goal rather than all the uncertainty we had before, which is nice.                               
                                     </p>
                                <p>
                                    The story we’ve decided on is set in a cyberpunk world and could contain lots of different exciting elements - it gives the design and programming teams a lot more freedom of choice to incorporate different features they might find interesting. For example, Mohamed and Ryan are currently working on implementing a Keycard to open a door in our MVP Level (which will be set as a prison escape!) and a jump pack to incorporate the Metroidvania feel we’re going for.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Future is looking good, feeling like things are coming together better at this point. For this week I thought I’d ask one of our programming team members, Ryan, to let me know about his personal experience in this project so far -

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “So far learning libGDX has been a new experience, while it can be frustrating trying to figure out the answers to problems, it has also given me an idea of what it is like in industry, having to follow deadlines and communicate well with team members.”
                                </p>

                                    Finally ready for the MVP!
                                </p>
                                <p>Some excellent work on background graphics by Brad and a boss sprite from Dan has really pulled the project together, we’re feeling confident that we’ve done what we could do going into the presentation. Mohamed and Ryan have got the keycard and the double jump pack working correctly and have a nice looking UI implemented to display our characters current inventory. We had some challenges at the end with our games UI not translating to different resolutions correctly and enemy spawns being erratic, but these issues will be solved quickly in the future.</p>
                                <p>
                                    We’ve still got a ways to go with our software engineering process as we haven’t managed to avoid a “Big Bang” integration at the end but we’ll definitely learn from this and ensure we work better in future. I feel it’s more a symptom of our issues at the start than our current mindset though, so that is encouraging.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Looking forward to the future, we hope to have a much larger map for the finished project with NPC’s included which will be our next big task. I look forward to keeping you updated on this project in January, have a good Christmas!
